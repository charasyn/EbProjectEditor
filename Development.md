## Building
To get started, here are all the tools you need:
* IntelliJ
* [snakeyaml-2.2.jar](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/yaml/snakeyaml/2.2/snakeyaml-2.2.jar)
* Github Desktop
* The EBProjEdit Repository

1. Clone the EBProjEdit Repository in Github Desktop, then open the project folder in IntelliJ.
2. Copy the `snakeyaml-2.2.jar` file into the project folder as `snakeyaml.jar`.
3. Go to `Build > Build Project` and wait for it to finish building. This will produce `out/artifacts/EbProjectEditor.jar`.
4. Once the build finishes, go `Run > Run 'EbProjectEditor.jar'`.
5. You should now be running the newly-built JAR file. Enjoy!
